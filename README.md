# Firebase onSnapshot Unsubscribe Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase's `onSnapshot` function where unsubscribing doesn't work as expected.  The problem occurs when the unsubscribe function, returned by `onSnapshot`, is not properly called or managed, resulting in continuous data listening even after it is no longer needed.  This can lead to performance issues and potential memory leaks.

## Problem

The provided `firebaseBug.js` showcases an attempt to unsubscribe from a real-time listener using `onSnapshot`.  However, due to [insert specific reason for the bug, e.g., improper scoping, premature function termination, etc.], the unsubscribe function isn't properly invoked resulting in continued listening.  This is highlighted by console logs that don't stop when expected.

## Solution

The solution, in `firebaseBugSolution.js`, addresses the issue by [explain the core fix, e.g., ensuring the unsubscribe function is called within the correct scope, managing the unsubscribe function using a cleanup mechanism, etc.].  The improved code demonstrates proper unsubscribe functionality.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install Firebase (refer to Firebase documentation).
3.  Set up a Firebase project and configure the `firebaseConfig` in `firebaseBug.js` and `firebaseBugSolution.js` with your project's credentials.
4.  Run `firebaseBug.js` and observe that console logging persists even after expected termination.
5.  Then, run `firebaseBugSolution.js`, and observe how logging appropriately stops after the intended time.
